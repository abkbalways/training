Ruby Basics by Ajay Agrawal in Beryl Systems

Installation of rvm and ruby :-

1. sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl

2. Add RVM GPG key on Ubuntu 20.04 Linux

curl -sSL https://rvm.io/mpapis.asc | gpg --import -
curl -sSL https://rvm.io/pkuczynski.asc | gpg --import -

3.  Command to Install RVM on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable

4. Check the RVM version

Once the installation is completed reload the shell to start using the RVM command-line tool:

source ~/.bashrc

rvm --version

5.  List Ruby version available to install

rvm list known

6. Install the latest ruby

rvm install ruby

To get some particular old version, declare the version number:

rvm install 2.7.2

7. Set default or Switch to the Ruby version you want to use

rvm use 3.0.0

For setting default one:

rvm use 3.0.0 --default

- Interactive Ruby (Irb) :-

Its provide a shell for experimentation . Within this we can run ruby expression result , line by line .

For out from irb :

ctrl + d

- White Spaces in ruby :-

These are generally ignored by ruby except whenthey appear in strings. Sometimes, However they are used to interpret ambiguous statements .

Ex -

a + b is interpreted as a+b (Here a is a local variable)

a  +b is interpreted as a(+b) (Here a is a method call)

- Line Endings in ruby programs :-

Ruby interprets semicolons and new line characters as the ending of the statement. However if ruby encounters operators, such as +,-, pr backshlash at the end of the line , they indicate the contiunation of statement. 

Hello Ruby Program :-

# My First Ruby Program

puts "Hello World in Ruby !!";


-> Save this by any name like test.rb
-> run "ruby test.rb" in terminal

OUTPUT :-

Hello World in Ruby !!


Ruby Class and Objects :-

A class is a blueprint from which individual objects are created.

For Example :- 

Bicycle is the object of class Vehicles . and speetding , breaking , etc. are their functions.

Syntax :

class Classname

#content

end


1. Local Variables - These are the methods which is defined inside the methods. and we can't useVariables in a ruby :-

We have four types of variables in ruby .

1. Local Variables - These are the methods which is defined inside the methods. and we can't use that outside the method. Local variables started with lowercase letter or _.

Example :-

class Abc
def hello
    a = "hello world"; # local variable and this scope is only in this method .
    puts a;
end
end
my = Abc.new;
my.hello;


OUTPUT : 

hello world

2. Instance Variable 

These area available across methods for any particular instance or object . It means it will be change for object to object. These are preceded by the sign (@) followed by the variable name . 

Example :-

class Student
def initialize(id,name,marks)
        @id = id        # instance variable
        @name = name    # instance variable
        @marks =marks   # instance variable
        puts(@id,@name,@marks);
    
end

s1 = Student.new(101,'RAM',80);
s2 = Student.new(102,'SHYAM',70);
end

OUTPUT :-

101
RAM
80
102
SHYAM
70


3. Class Variable

These are available across different objects. It is belong with a class and is a characterstic of class . These are preceded by (@@) and are the followed by the variable name.

Example :-

class Student
@@cid = 121;    # class variable
def initialize(id,name,marks)
        @id = id        # instance variable
        @name = name    # instance variable
        @marks =marks   # instance variable
        puts(@@cid,@id,@name,@marks);  
    
end


s1 = Student.new(101,'RAM',80);
s2 = Student.new(102,'SHYAM',70);
end

OUTPUT :-

121
101
RAM
80
121
102
SHYAM
70

4. Global Variable

Class variable is not available across classes. If we want to make a variable which is available in all classes , we want to make a Global Variable . The global variables are preceded by the dollar($) sign.

Example :

$sid = 's101'   # global variable
class Student
@@cid = 121;    # class variable
def initialize(id,name,marks)
        @id = id        # instance variable
        @name = name    # instance variable
        @marks =marks   # instance variable
        puts($sid,@@cid,@id,@name,@marks,"\n");  
    
end


s1 = Student.new(101,'RAM',80);
s2 = Student.new(102,'SHYAM',70);
end

class Student2
    @@cid = 131;    # class variable
    def initialize(id,name,marks)
            @id = id        # instance variable
            @name = name    # instance variable
            @marks =marks   # instance variable
            puts($sid,@@cid,@id,@name,@marks,"\n");  
        
    end
    
    
    s1 = Student.new(201,'JATIN',90);
    s2 = Student.new(202,'LAKHAN',80);
end


OUTPUT :

s101
121
101
RAM
80

s101
121
102
SHYAM
70

s101
121
201
JATIN
90

s101
121
202
LAKHAN
80


Constants :- 

These are begin with uppercase letter. These can be define in or outside the class . but cannot not be defined in the method or function.

Example :

class Add

 A=5;
 B=6;
 C=A+B;
 def add
    puts("The result of #{A} + #{B} is #{C}");
 end
end

obj=Add.new();
obj.add;

OUTPUT :

The result of 5 + 6 is 11

Comments :-

(a) Single Line Comment :

We can give comment precided by #.

Ex:

puts "Delhi is the capital of India"   #I am Comment

OUTPUT :

Delhi is the capital of India

(b) Multi Line Comment :

We can comment multiple line . But it can be in starting of program or first line of program by syntax =begin and =end as follows

EX : 

begin 
I am the multiple lines comment . we can break line in that type of comment 
=end

puts "Delhi is the capital of India" 


OUTPUT :

Delhi is the capital of India


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operators :


(a) Ruby Arithmetic operators :

Assume variable a=5 and b=10 , 

+   - 15 ((a+b)It add both values)

-   - -5 ((a-b), it subtract second value from first value)

*   - 50 ((a*b), it multiply both values)

/   - 2 ((b/a), it divides b by a)

%   - 0 ((b%a), it gives the remainder of b/a)

**  - (a**b), it will give the 5 to the power 10.

(b) Ruby Comparision Operators :

These are used for compare values or conditions,

Assume a=5 and b=10 ,

==     - FALSE (it gives true if a is equals to b otherwise false).

!=     - TRUE (it gives true when a is not equals to b otherwise false)

<      - TRUE (it gives true if a is less than b otherwise false)

>      - FALSE (it gives true if a is greater than b otherwise false)

<=     - TRUE (it gives true if a is less than or equals to b otherwise false)

>=     - FALSE (it gives true if a is greater than or equals to b otherwise false)

<=>    - -1 (0 if a equals to b,1 if a is greater than b and -1 if a is less than b)

===    - (1...10)===5 returns TRUE (1...10 means 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)

.eql?  - it will check type and value also .



(c) Ruby Assignment Operators

These operators are used for assigning values to variables.

=       - it is used for assign values. (a=5 or c=a+b)

+=      - c += a , c=c+a

-=      - c -= a , c=c-a

*=      - c *= a , c=c*a

/=      - c /= a , c=c/a

%=      - c %= a , c=c%a

(d) Ruby Parallel operators

it is used for multiple variables initialization in single line.

Ex - 

a,b,c = 12,52,98

it is also used for swapping values

Ex - 

a=2
b=3

a,b=b,a

puts(a,b)

OUTPUT :

3
2

(e) Ruby Logical Operators

AND or &&    - if both the conditions are true then return true otherwise false. 

OR  or ||    - if both the conditions are false then return false otherwise true.

NOT or !     - it is used for reverse the logical operator. it gives !(true) = false and vice-versa.

(f) Ruby Range Operators

..           - (1..10) gives range from 1 to 10.

...          - (1...10) gives range from 1 to 9.

(g) Ruby ternary Operators

Firstly it evaluates the condition , if condition is true it returns first value otherwise second.

For Example : 

a=5
if(a>3)?puts("yes"):puts("no")
end

OUTPUT :

yes


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conditions :

(a) Ruby if else

Syntax -

if condition
code
elsif condition
code
elsif condition
code
else
code


Example :


a=6
b=7
c=8
if(a>b && a>c)
    puts("#$a is greater than b and c")
elsif(b>a && b>c)
    puts("b is greater than a and c")
else
    puts("c is greater than b and c")

end


OUTPUT :

c is greater than b and c


(b) Ruby if modifier

Executes the code if condition is true .

syntax :

code if condition

Example :

age =19

puts("You are eligible for vote") if(age>=18)


Output :

You are eligible for vote

(c) Ruby Unless statement

Execute code if condition is false , if condition is true then , code specified in else will be executed.

Syntax :

unless condition
code
else
code
end

Example :

age =19

unless(age>18)
    puts("You are not eligible for vote")
else
    puts("You are eligible for vote")
end


OUTPUT :

You are eligible for vote


(d) Ruby Unless Modifier

Syntax :

code unless codition

Example :

$var=1

puts "1 -- value is set" if($var)
puts "2 -- value is set" unless($var)

$var=false

puts "3 - -value is set" unless($var)

OUTPUT :

1 -- value is set
3 - -value is set


(e) Ruby case Statement

Syntax :

case expr0
when expr1, expr2
stmt1
when expr3, expr4
stmt2
else
stmt3
end

Example :

$marks = 72
case $marks
when 50..60
    puts "Grade E"
when 60..70
    puts "Grade D"
when 70..80
    puts "Grade C"
when 80..90
    puts "Grade B"
when 90..100
    puts "Grade A"
else
    puts "FAIL"
end

OUTPUT :

Grade C

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Loops :

It is used for execute same block of code many times .

(a) Ruby while loop

Syntax :

while condition
code 
end

or 

while condition do
code
end

Example :-

$i=0
$n=5

while($i<$n) 
    puts ($i)
    $i +=1
end

OUTPUT :
0
1
2
3
4


(b) Ruby While modifier

it will execute code atleast one time before check condition.

Syntax :

code while condition

or 

begin
code
end while condition

Example 1 :

$i=0
$n=5

begin
    puts ($i)
    $i +=1
end while($i<$n) 

OUTPUT :

0
1
2
3
4


Example 2 :


$i=0
$n=5

begin
    puts ($i)
    $i +=1
end while($i>$n) 


OUTPUT :

0


(c) until while statement

It executes the code when condition is false . an until statement condition is separated from code by reserved word do, a new line or a semicolon.

Syntax :

until condition do
code
end

Example :

$i=0
$n=5

until $i>$n do
    puts("The values of i is #$i")
    $i += 1
end

OUTPUT :

The values of i is 0
The values of i is 1
The values of i is 2
The values of i is 3
The values of i is 4
The values of i is 5


(d) Ruby until modifier

It executes code while condition is false.

If an until modifier follows a begin statement with no rescue or ensure clauses , code is executed once before conditional is evaluated.

syntax :

begin
code
end until condition

Example :

$i=0
$n=5

begin
    puts("The values of i is #$i")
    $i += 1
end until $i>$n

OUTPUT :

The values of i is 0
The values of i is 1
The values of i is 2
The values of i is 3
The values of i is 4
The values of i is 5

(e) Ruby for loop

It executes code once for each element in expression.

Syntax :

for variable in expression 
code
end

Example :

$i=0
for i in 1...5
    puts(i)
end

OUTPUT :

1
2
3
4

Other method for achieve this equivalent to for loop :

Example :

$i=0
(1...5).each do |i|
    puts(i)
end

OUTPUT :

1
2
3
4

(f) Ruby break statement

It terminates the most internal loop . and after achieve break statement that loop will be terminated and code is not executed for any other values.

Syntax :

break

Example :

$i=0
for i in 1...5
    if i>2
        break
    end
  puts("The value of i is #{i}")
end

OUTPUT :

The value of i is 1
The value of i is 2

(g) Ruby next statement

It terminates the most internal loop for that condition for which next statement is defined . it jumps to next iteration and skip the iteration in which next defined.

Syntax : 

next

Example :

$i=0
for i in 1...5
    if i==3
        next   # it will skip 3
    end
  puts("The value of i is #{i}")
end

OUTPUT :

The value of i is 1
The value of i is 2
The value of i is 4 


(h) Ruby redo statement 

It restart the iteration of most internal loop, without checking loop condition .

Syntax :

redo

Example : 

$i=0
for i in 1...5
    if i==3
        puts("The value of i is #{i}")
        redo  
    end
  
end

OUTPUT :

The value of i is 3
The value of i is 3
The value of i is 3
The value of i is 3
The value of i is 3
The value of i is 3
...................

it will print till infinite


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ruby methods :

It is the set of statements which perform some specific task and returns the result. it allow to user reusing the code without retypin the code. 

Defining and calling methods in ruby :

method can be defined by keyword def followed by method_name (should be in lower case). we can call method by just type the name of method. method must be defined before calling.

Syntax :

def method_name
statement 1 
statement 2
end

Example :

def method_1
    puts "method 1 is calling"
end
def method_2
    puts "method 2 is calling"
end
method_1
method_2

OUTPUT :

method 1 is calling
method 2 is calling

-- > Passing parameters to the method

it is like the passing parameters to method in other languages. we want to just write parameter in braces.

Syntax :

def method_name(var1,var2,var3)
statement 1
statement 2
.
.
end

Example :

def city(var1="name",var2="city")
    puts "name is #{var1}"
    puts "city is #{var2}"
end

puts "With Parameters"
city "jatin","mathura"
puts ""
puts"Without Parameters"
city


OUTPUT :

With Parameters
name is jatin
city is mathura

Without Parameters
name is name
city is city

--> Ruby Methods with no. of parameters.

Ruby allows to define a method that can take variable no. of arguments. It is useful when the user doesn't know the no. of parameters to be passed when method is defining.

Syntax :

def method_name(*var_name)
statement 1
statement 2
end


Example :

def city(*var1)
    puts "\nNumber of cities are #{var1.length}"

    for i in 0...var1.length
        puts "Cities are #{var1[i]}"
    end
end
city "mathura","delhi"
city "faridabad","palwal","ballabgarh"
city "lucknow"

OUTPUT :

Number of cities are 2
Cities are mathura
Cities are delhi

Number of cities are 3
Cities are faridabad
Cities are palwal
Cities are ballabgarh

Number of cities are 1
Cities are lucknow


--> return statement in methods

It is used for return one or more values from methods .By default, method return last statement that was evaluated from body of the method.

Syntax :

return

Example 1 :

def num
a = 7
b = 9

sum=a+b
diff = b-a

return sum
end

puts "The result is #{num}"

OUTPUT :

The result is 16

Example 2 :

def num
a = 7
b = 9

sum=a+b
diff = b-a

return sum,diff
end

puts "The result is #{num}"

OUTPUT :

The result is [16, 2]


--> Ruby undef methods

It is used to cancel the definition of method or delete the method.

Syntax :

undef method-name

Example :

def num
a = 7
b = 9
sum=a+b
diff = b-a
return sum
end

undef num

puts "The result is #{num}"

OUTPUT :

test.rb:11:in `<main>': undefined local variable or method `num' for main:Object (NameError)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
  

BLOCKS IN RUBY 

It is like the methods but it does not belong to an object . Blocks are called objects in other programming languages. Some important points about blocks are

-> Blocks can accept arguments and return the value

-> Block does not have their own name 

-> Blocks consist of chunks of code

-> It is always invoked with a function or can say passed to a method call

-> To call a block with in a method with value, yield statement is used.

-> Block can be called just like methods from inside the method that it is passed to 

A block code can be used in two ways as follows

1. inside the do..end statement 

Syntax :

block_name do 

statement
statement

end



Example :

["Ajay","Agrawal",21].each do |n|  # each is method name or block name and n is variable

    puts(n);
end

OUTPUT :

Ajay
Agrawal
21


2. Inline between the curly braces

Syntax :

block_name {statement}

Example :

["Ajay","Agrawal",21].each {|n| puts n}

OUTPUT :

Ajay
Agrawal
21

Block Arguments :

Block Arguments can be passed between the enclosing pipes || .

Example : 

student_names = ["utkarsh","ram","hritik","jatin","garima","lalita"]

student_names.each do |student_names| # students_names are arguments inside the pipes ||
    puts(student_names)
end


OUTPUT :

utkarsh
ram
hritik
jatin
garima
lalita


-> How Block returns values

Actually block return the values which is returned by the method in which it is called.

Example :

puts [1,2,3,4,5].select {|num| num.odd?}  #their are two methods select and odd

OUTPUT :

1
3
5


-> The yield statement

It is used to call a block inside the method using yield keyword with values.

Example :

def anything
    puts "Inside the method"
    yield                     #CALL BLOCK INSIDE THE METHOD
    puts "Again Inside the method"
    yield                     #AGAIN CALL METHOD
end

anything{puts "Inside block"}   #BLOCK


OUTPUT :

nside the method
Inside block
Again Inside the method
Inside block

-->WITH PARAMETERS

Example :

def anything
    puts "Inside the method"
    yield "P1"                    #CALL BLOCK INSIDE THE METHOD
    puts "Again Inside the method"
    yield "P2"                   #AGAIN CALL METHOD
end

anything{|para| puts "Inside block #{para}"}   #BLOCK

OUTPUT :

Inside the method
Inside block P1
Again Inside the method
Inside block P2


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ruby Iterators :

Iterators are nothing but methods supported by collections. Collections is the object that stores group of data members. In Ruby Arrays and Hashes can be termed collections.

Iterators returns each elements of collection. one after other.

(a) Ruby each iterator 

The each iterator return all elements of Array or a Hash. 

Syntax :

collection.each do |variable|
code
end

Example : 

ary=[1,2,3,4,5]

ary.each do |num|                           #each is the iterator which return all elements one by one
    puts "Element of Collection : #{num}"
end

OUTPUT :

Element of Collection : 1
Element of Collection : 2
Element of Collection : 3
Element of Collection : 4
Element of Collection : 5

(b)
