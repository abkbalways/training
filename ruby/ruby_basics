- Interactive Ruby (Irb) :-

Its provide a shell for experimentation . Within this we can run ruby expression result , line by line .

For out from irb :

ctrl + d

- White Spaces in ruby :-

These are generally ignored by ruby except whenthey appear in strings. Sometimes, However they are used to interpret ambiguous statements .

Ex -

a + b is interpreted as a+b (Here a is a local variable)

a  +b is interpreted as a(+b) (Here a is a method call)

- Line Endings in ruby programs :-

Ruby interprets semicolons and new line characters as the ending of the statement. However if ruby encounters operators, such as +,-, pr backshlash at the end of the line , they indicate the contiunation of statement. 

Hello Ruby Program :-

# My First Ruby Program

puts "Hello World in Ruby !!";


-> Save this by any name like test.rb
-> run "ruby test.rb" in terminal

OUTPUT :-

Hello World in Ruby !!
