Ruby Strings By Ajay Agrawal at Beryl Systems 


Strings : 

A string object in ruby holds and manipulates an arbitrary sequence of one or more bytes, typically representing characters that represent human language.

The Simplest string enclosed in single quotes .

Example :

my_name ='Ajay'    #my_name is the varible which holds 'Ajay' string

puts my_name


OUTPUT :

Ajay


-> Apostrophe Character

If we need to place apostrophe character in single quote , precided by backslash (\).

Example :

text ='I don\'t have a dog'

puts text


OUTPUT :

I don't have a dog
